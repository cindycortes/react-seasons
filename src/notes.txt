Component Lifecycle:

componentDidMount() - will be called once, good place to do data-loading. 
componentDidUpdate() - can be called anytime, more data loading when state/props change
componentWillUnmount() - clean up

                        // prop = value
            // property from the state of the app component and passing it as a prop down into the season display
            // can take a state from one component and pass it down as a prop to the child
